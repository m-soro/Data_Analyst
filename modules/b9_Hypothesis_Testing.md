## Hypothesis Testing

## Setting Up Hypothesis Tests - Part I

<iframe width="100%" height="805" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NpZxJg4S6X4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In this video, you learned a few rules for setting up null and alternative hypotheses:

1. The <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large H_0 "> is true before you collect any data.

2. The <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large H_0 "> usually states there is no effect or that two groups are equal.

 3. The <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large H_0 "> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large H_1 "> are competing, non-overlapping hypotheses.

4. <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large H_1 ">is what we would like to prove to be true.

5. <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large H_0 "> contains an equal sign of some kind - either <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large\ = , ≤, ≥">.

6. <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large H_1 "> contains the opposition of the null - either <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large\ != , >, <">.


You saw that the statement, "Innocent until proven guilty" is one that suggests the following hypotheses are true:

* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large H_0 ">: Innocent

* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large H_1 ">: Guilty

We can relate this to the idea that "innocent" is true before we collect any data. Then the alternative must be a competing, non-overlapping hypothesis. Hence, the alternative hypothesis is that an individual is guilty.

## Setting Up Hypothesis Tests - Part II

Because we wanted to test if a new page was better than an existing page, we set that up in the alternative. Two indicators are that the null should hold the equality, and the statement we would like to be true should be in the alternative. Therefore, it would look like this:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large H_0: \mu_1 ≤ \mu_2">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large H_1: \mu_1 > \mu_2">

Here <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large\mu_1"> represents the population mean return from the new page. Similarly, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large\mu_2"> represents the population mean return from the old page.

Depending on your question of interest, you would change your null and alternative hypotheses to match.
