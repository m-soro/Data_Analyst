# My Projects

***

### 1. [Explore Weather Trends](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/m-soro/Data_Analyst/blob/main/projects/project1/DA_Project1_Submission.ipynb)

* Analyze weather trend using pandas and matplotlib.

### 2. [Investigate a Dataset](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/m-soro/Data_Analyst/blob/main/projects/project2/Project2_DAND_final.ipynb)

* For this project I decided to investigate the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System or NICS. This is supplemented by Census data from [census.gov](https://www.census.gov/) for 2010 and 2016.

* This project required data wrangling, cleaning and re structuring to make it more suitable for analysis.
