# Post your work on Github

In this project, you will learn important tools that all programmers use. First, you’ll get an introduction to working in the terminal. Next, you’ll learn to use git and Github to manage versions of a program and collaborate with others on programming projects. You will post two different versions of a Jupyter Notebook capturing your learnings from the course, and add commits to your project Git repository.
