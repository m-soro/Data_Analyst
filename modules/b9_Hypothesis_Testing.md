## Hypothesis Testing

## Setting Up Hypothesis Tests - Part I

<iframe width="100%" height="805" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NpZxJg4S6X4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In this video, you learned a few rules for setting up null and alternative hypotheses:

1. The <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge H_0 "> is true before you collect any data.

2. The <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge H_0 "> usually states there is no effect or that two groups are equal.

 3. The <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge H_0 "> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge H_1 "> are competing, non-overlapping hypotheses.

4. <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge H_1 ">is what we would like to prove to be true.

5. <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge H_0 "> contains an equal sign of some kind - either <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge\ = , ≤, ≥">.

6. <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge H_1 "> contains the opposition of the null - either <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge\ != , >, <">.


You saw that the statement, "Innocent until proven guilty" is one that suggests the following hypotheses are true:

* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge H_0 ">: Innocent

* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge H_1 ">: Guilty

We can relate this to the idea that "innocent" is true before we collect any data. Then the alternative must be a competing, non-overlapping hypothesis. Hence, the alternative hypothesis is that an individual is guilty.
